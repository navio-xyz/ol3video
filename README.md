# ol3video
An open source JS library to synchronize video and gps data in Openlayers

The source code is currently in a private repository and will be released in this public repository in July for the 2017 AGIT conference.
You may already have a look at a demo site using the ol3video library (https://www.gps-cam.net). Please use Chrome or Firefox. An app version will be available in the Playstore and iTunes by mid August 2017.
